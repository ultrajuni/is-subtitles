# is-subtitles
This tool allows you to customize a subtitle animation based on the one from Ice Scream. You can change the text, background color, background opacity, text color, font size, and animation times (fade-in, hold, fade-out). You can also upload custom font files (.ttf, .otf).
The true intend on this was to help people in making fanmade subtitles in the Ice Scream style. I've saw a lot of people doing it wrong, so this goes especially to them.
